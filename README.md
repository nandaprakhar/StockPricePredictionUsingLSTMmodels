# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM ðŸ“ˆðŸ¤–  

This project leverages historical stock market data to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for stock price prediction. The model learns from past price patterns and trends, enabling accurate predictions of future stock prices. The LSTM network is specifically designed to capture long-term dependencies, making it highly effective for time series forecasting tasks.  

## Tools and Technologies Used  
- **Python Libraries:**  
  - **Data Manipulation:** NumPy, Pandas  
  - **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  - **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn  

## Key Features  
1. **Time Series Data Analysis:**  
   - Preprocesses and analyzes historical stock market data to identify patterns and trends.  
   - Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations for better insights.  

2. **LSTM Model Training:**  
   - Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build and train an LSTM network tailored for time series forecasting.  
   - Captures long-term dependencies in stock price trends.  

3. **Stock Price Prediction:**  
   - Predicts future stock prices based on learned patterns from historical data.  
   - Provides robust evaluation metrics to measure prediction accuracy.  

4. **Visualization and Insights:**  
   - Leverages Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot historical data and predicted prices.  
   - Compares actual and predicted stock prices to assess model performance.
